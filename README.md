**A meticulously curated list of frameworks, tools, platforms, and resources for building autonomous AI agents in 2026.**

*If this list saved you research time, please ⭐ star it — it helps others find it too.*

</div>

---

The AI agent ecosystem grew faster in 2025 than most engineers could keep up with. New frameworks launched monthly, companies merged products, and the line between "agent framework" and "workflow automation" blurred entirely.

This list cuts through the noise. Every tool here has been evaluated against three questions:
- **Is it actually used in production?** (not just a demo repo)
- **Is it actively maintained?** (commit in the last 6 months)
- **Does it solve a real, specific problem?** (not just another LangChain wrapper)

Updated monthly. PRs welcome.

> **Market Snapshot:** $7.8B market size (2025) · 46% CAGR through 2030 · 40% of enterprise apps expected to have agents by EOY · AutoGPT peaked at 177k ⭐ — the most-starred AI agent repo in history
